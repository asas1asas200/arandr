Development tools for ARandR
============================

build_xrandrs.sh
----------------

Script that can be called on the xrandr tool's git repository. It builds the
various released versions xrandr in order to test them against ARandR. Be aware
that this affects only the client tool; unless all the versions built are
tested against different versions of the X server (including different
hardware), tests done using it are not likely to be comprehensive.
