Development tools for ARandR
============================

build_xrandrs.sh
----------------

Script that can be called on the xrandr tool's git repository. It builds the
various released versions xrandr in order to test them against ARandR. Be aware
that this affects only the client tool; unless all the versions built are
tested against different versions of the X server (including different
hardware), tests done using it are not likely to be comprehensive.

Run inside a checkout of the xrandr program without arguments.

build_xrandr_archives.sh
------------------------

Script that runs the typical ARandR queries (--help, --version, --query
--verbose) iteratively with its arguments as PATH, storing the results in a
stateless output.zip file in the respective folders. The first argument is
used as output file name (eg. output.zip or
output-with-configured-projector.zip) to discern multiple hardware
configurations

Run from the arandr repository (or from anywhere if the screenlayout module is
installed) with a .zip argument and a wildcard matching all directories
resulting from build_xrandrs.sh as arguments.
