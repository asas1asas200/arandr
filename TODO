 * add option to make layout default on startup
 * implement missing xrandr features: reflect, additional modes (for forcibly applying saved layouts so they are already active when an output is connected), fb, fbmm/dpi
 * call xrandr without blocking
 * receive notifications on changes (XRRScreenChangeNotify)
 * don't reset displays moved over edges; instead, move as far as possible
 * allow setting dpi
 
 * integrate related settings: (might end up writing a complete configuration manager, which is not my intention)
  * xsetwacom
  * gnome-panel layout
